# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the PyBer Analysis
### Purpose
PyBer, a ride sharing app company, tasked us with analyzing data to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. We created a DataFrame to analyze the total weekly fares by city type. From this DataFrame, we then created a line graph to aid our findings for PyBerâ€™s CEO.
