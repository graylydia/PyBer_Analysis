# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the PyBer Analysis
### Purpose
PyBer, a ride sharing app company, tasked us with analyzing data to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. We created a DataFrame to analyze the total weekly fares by city type. From this DataFrame, we then created a line graph to aid our findings for PyBer’s CEO.
## Results

After creating our summary DataFrame for PyBer, we found the number of total rides, drivers, fares, the average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver. As you can see, Urban city types had the most total rides, drivers, and fares with 1,625 number of rides, 2,405 number of drivers, and $39,854.38 total fares. The average fare per ride was $24.53 and the average fare per driver was $16.57 for Urban cities. Suburban cities had 625 total rides, 490 total drivers, and $19,356.33 in total fares. Their average fare per ride was $30.97 and average fare per driver was $39.50. Whereas rural cities had the least amount of rides, drivers, and fares. The total rides for rural cities was 125 with 78 total drivers and $4,327.93 in total fares. The average fare per ride was $34.62 and the average fare per driver was $55.49. After reviewing this data, it makes sense when you think about the population differences in urban, suburban, and rural areas.
